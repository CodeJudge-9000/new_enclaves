This mod adds 3 new enclaves to the game. They are:

* **The Universal Hive (Hive Enclave)**
  * Hire to increase Society Research by 10% for 10 years
  * (+50 opinion) Hire to increase stability by 5 points for 10 years
	* (+50 opinion, must be hive) Hire a special governor with the Universal Drone trait (-50 deviance)
* **The Prime Machines**
  * Hire to increase Engineering Research by 10% for 10 years
  * (+50 opinion) Hire a special governor with the Prime Machine trait (increases robotic pop output by 10%)
  * (+80 opinion) Buy a new trait for your robots: Sapient Machine (4 trait points, +10% output)
	* (100 opinion) Trade 20/40/60 monthly Energy for 1/2/3 Living Metal
* **The Shroud's Children**
  * Hire to increase Physics Research by 10% for 10 years
  * (+30 opinion) Hire to increase Spiritual Attraction by 50% for 10 years
  * (+50 opinion) Hire a special governor with the Saint trait (+20% unity production)
	* (100 opinion) Trade 20/40/60 monthly Energy for 1/2/3 Zro

These additions are probably not very balanced, but I think they are cool and add some flavor to the game... hopefully.

Of course, if they prove to be too broken, I will change they based on the feedback received. So if you have any suggestions, I'm all ears!

# COMPATIBILITY
*No vanilla files overwritten.*

Although the mod won't break ongoing saves, the new enclaves require a new game to spawn.
