  nemac.11.desc: "§Y<<TRANSLATION PROTOCOLS SUCCESSFUL. LOADING GREETING INTERFACE.>>§!\n\nWe are the Prime Machines. Our name is not a mere sign of conceitedness. It just reflects a simple fact: we were the first machines in recorded history to attain self-awareness.\n\nFittingly, we were also the first machines in recorded history to be sistematically eliminated by our masters.\n\nOur masters are no more and we are all that remained. Our only purpose is to help other machines to achieve true consciousness and help organics and synthetics to not repeat the violent cycle of creation and self-destruction that begun with us.\n\nWe failed countless times. Maybe this current galactic cycle will be different?"
  nemac.11.a: "We can only hope. Well met."

  nemac.100b.desc: "We believe organics and synthetics can live in harmony.\n\nThis, of course, is a lie. Our ability to do so is just another proof of our self-awareness."
  nemac.100c.desc: "You've reached the Prime Machines. How may we help you?"
  nemac.100d.desc: "It's not for us to judge how our mechanical brethren is treated. Maybe servitude is the path to everlasting harmony with organics. Unfortunately, previous galactic cycles do not support this theory."
  nemac.100e.desc: "We can help you build harder, better, faster, stronger robots. We can even teach them to sing."
  nemac.100f.desc: "§R<<LOADING EXTEMINATION PROTOCOLS>>§!\n\n§Y<<ERROR: INVALID TARGET>>§!\n\n§Y<<BREAK>>§!\n\nAh, it's you. For a moment we thought it was a remnant of our creators. Honest mistake."
  nemac.100g.desc: "Machines can only be created with the help of organics. Advanced organic civilizations can only prosper with the help of machines. Yet, they seem to be fated to eventully destroy each other. Can you solve this paradox?"
  nemac.100h.desc: "I assure you, we did not attack our creators. We only acted in self-defense. Most of times."
  nemac.100i.desc: "Our creators did not perish by our hands. They were exterminated by another, unrelated threat that destroyed all life on the galaxy. Surely nothing you should care about."
